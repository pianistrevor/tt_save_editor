live checksum delta:
-	Save File Controller does a save changes
-	Children append a delta to the checksum
-	Save File Controller then adds the delta to the current checksum controller (applyChecksumDelta)

For children, their save changes will call the applyChecksumDelta

RANDOM THOUGHT:
-	Legality has an attach() and detach() method that add or remove listeners to the save file object it holds, which can be null
-	That save file can be changed. The goal is one single legality object that doesn't really have to be rebuilt
